# airport_simulation
C project to mimic an airport under certain conditions

This is a simple project that simulates an airport under conditions given by the user. The user decides the maximum number of planes that a runway queue can hold, the traffic index of the airport and the amount of units of time the simulation has to occur. This project is a good demonstration of the singly linked list implementation of a queue. Various other concepts like pointers, structures, random functions,etc have been used.
